    <h2>My Life</h2>
    <h3>
      <p>
        I like code,games,sports,vacations and Disneyland. I am just starting to learn how to code and honestly it is pretty fun. I want to be a Software imagineer for disney someday. <br>
        I also like to play games as in video games,board games, exc. I also like sports! <br> I play Baseball,Basketball, and football with my friends. My favorite sport is basketball. I always love going on vacaitions in fact this spring break we
        were supposed to go to washington D.C
        and New york! <br> I also went on two vacations to Arizona! The first trip to Arizona was just my dad and I. We were supposed to go to the Grand Canyon But when we headed through flagstaff it started snowing so we turned around and got into a
        car crash. <br> But my dad promised we would go back next year and we did! <br> And we got a fancy hotel room,pools everywhere and we even got to finally visit the grand canyon which was just amazing! And that was probobly my favorite
        vacation! <br>other than that we've been on a cruise to Alaska, Canada,trip to oregon, and to Sonoma,Aneheim,San Fransisco and the Golden gate bridge in California! <br> I was very happy on all of those trips but their is one place in
        California that is the happiest place on earth! Disneyland! I have always loved going to disneyland I cant even count how many times i've been. Its just the best! <br>
